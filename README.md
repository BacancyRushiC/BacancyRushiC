👋 Hi, I’m Rushi Chudasama, aka @Rushi-45
👀 I’m interested in all things tech, especially frontend development with a passion for adding motion magic to interfaces. When I'm not coding, you can find me dancing salsa!
🌱 I’m currently diving deep into frontend development and motion design.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Framer Motion and other cool frontend animations.
